?? Summary
This is a basic MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) setup using the paho-mqtt Python library. It demonstrates how a publisher can send messages to a topic (iot/topic), and how a subscriber can receive those messages by subscribing to the same topic.
* Publisher: Sends a "Hello from Publisher" message every 5 seconds to the topic.
* Subscriber: Listens to the same topic and prints any message it receives.


Concepts Demonstrated
* MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for IoT devices.
* Publisher/Subscriber model decouples message senders and receivers.
* Broker (like Mosquitto) is required to relay messages between clients.




HOW TO RUN:

Need to open three different terminal and run each file on each terminal

python subscriber.py



to start the mosquetto MQTT broker

mosquitto -v
